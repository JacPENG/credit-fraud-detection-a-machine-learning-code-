# credit-fraud-detection-a-machine-learning-code-
This project explores which Machine Learning method delivers the best performance, and which variable is the most important feature in the detection of credit card fraud. The methods used in this project are Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The result shows that Decision Trees and Random Forest perform better detections. In addition, “ratio_to_median_purchase_price” which reflects the capture of unconventional consumption records is chosen to be the most important feature in terms of credit card fraud detection.
